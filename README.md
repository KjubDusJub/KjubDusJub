Most of my projects usually rot on my private git server because I either never get through to finishing them or they're proprietary, so my GitHub account is a little unimpressive, but to any future employers, I swear I have more stuff. it's just not public, trust me, bro.

I usually write my code as low-end as I can, so I usually tend to favor C/C++ & Rust, but I still have extensive knowledge in HTML/JS (along with NodeJS and a few of the billions of JS frameworks, I <3 svelte), Python, Go, & C#/Java/Kotlin (they're all the same don't @ me).

I'm an Arch Linux guy, so while I probably preach it way more than I think I do, I try not to.

I also usually self-host all of my crap since I don't trust GCS/AWS or whoever, and also because I had an incident where GCS drew 300£ from me because I forgot to turn off an instance for an entire year. So now I have a giant server rack with a bunch of power-guzzling second-hand servers rotting in my storage room. It keeps the house warm, though, so I guess it's not all bad.

Unfortunately a part of the Vim cult... I also use a Kinesis 360.

I also have a website: https://kalsvik.no

I also have a contact email that resembles my full name, which is kinda neat: jonas@kalsvik.no
